## Tests
As I am not sure about the Copyright of the data in the LXCat database 
(the terms of service prohibit redistribution of the data), this repo does not
come with any data sets. If you want to perform the tests, please download
the Siglo dataset file which is supplied with Bolsig+ and place it in a folder 
called `data`.
